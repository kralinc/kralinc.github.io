                <p>Proximity is a strategy board game with the aim of having the highest score at the end.</p>
                <p>Each player gets a turn placing tiles. Every player gets the same set tiles, shuffled in a random order. In a turn, you draw a random tile and place it on the board. If the number of the tile you place is higher than a surrounding tile of a different color, those tiles change to your color and increase your score by their value. Have a higher score than your opponent at the end of the game to win.</p>

                <h3>Maximum Number of Tiles</h3>
                <p>Each player is given a set of numbers from 1 to this value. A higher value needs a larger board and a longer game.</p>
                <h3>Number of Players</h3>
                <p>The total number of players, human and AI combined.</p>
                <h3>Number of Humans</h3>
                <p>The number of human players. Any remaining players will be controlled by AI</p>
                <h3>AI Delay</h3>
                <p>The delay, in milliseconds, between when the AI chooses its move and when it makes its move. Higher values make it easier to see what the AI is doing, and is more ideal for games with human players. Lower values are better for AI-only games with a high number of tiles and/or players.</p>
                <h3>Allow Corners</h3>
                <p>If set to true, corner tiles will be considered adjacent to tiles. If false, corner tiles will not be adjacent.</p>
