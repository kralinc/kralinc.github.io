The gist of it is that you can space out flashcard practice along increasing intervals to remember the information more efficiently. If that piques your interest you should click the link.</p>

                        <p>A debate on the ArsTechnica forum from January 2000. The concept of DVD ever replacing VHS in the near future was very controversial. There's a stark mix of predictions that are wildly off the mark, and shockingly prescient. Some highlights include: one user doesn't believe affordable HDTVs will come out this century, and another user predicts streaming services.</p>

                        <p>An essential read if you're learning a 2nd+ language. A few hundred words in any language make up the bulk of what you'll hear and say. This provides a burst of motivation early in your journey. However, the 90% most common words very often let you understand less than 10% of the sentence's meaning. For that, you will need to know the tens of thousands of less common words, requiring exponentially more words for each additional percentage of language understanding.</p>
